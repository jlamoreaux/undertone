# Sync Feature Issue - Reproduction Report

## Test Date: 2025-01-08

## Expected Behavior
1. A "Sync" button should appear in the header when user is logged in
2. After marking a chapter as read, a sync toast notification should appear
3. Manual sync should be available via the Sync button

## Actual Behavior Observed

### 1. Application State
- Dev server running on http://localhost:8888
- Application loads successfully

### 2. Header Components (No Sync Button)
- **Found in header:**
  - Color scheme toggle (sun/moon icon)
  - Login/Sign In button
- **Missing:**
  - No Sync button visible in header

### 3. Code Analysis Results

#### Layout Component (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Contains `LoginButton` component
- Contains `ColorSchemeToggle` component  
- **Does NOT contain any Sync button component**

#### Auth Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Exports `performSync` function
- Exports `syncing` state
- Performs automatic sync on:
  - User sign in (line 61)
  - User sign out (line 100)
  - Initial session check (line 74)
- Shows sync toast notifications on success/failure

#### Recording Reading (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- `recordReading` function only saves to localStorage
- Does NOT trigger sync after recording
- No integration with `performSync` from AuthContext

### 4. Missing Implementations

1. **No Sync Button Component**: No component exists to render a sync button
2. **No Manual Sync UI**: Users cannot manually trigger sync
3. **No Auto-sync After Recording**: Recording chapters doesn't trigger sync
4. **No Sync Status Indicator**: No visual indication of sync state

## Conclusion

The sync functionality is partially implemented in the backend but lacks frontend UI components:
- The sync service and authentication context are properly set up
- Automatic sync occurs on login/logout
- Manual sync trigger and post-recording sync are missing
- No UI component exists for the Sync button

## Files That Need Modification
1. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Add Sync button to header
2. `src/app/page.tsx` - Trigger sync after recording reading
3. `src/app/book/[id]/page.tsx` - Trigger sync after recording from book page
