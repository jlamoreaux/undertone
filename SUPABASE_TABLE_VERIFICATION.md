# Supabase `reading_progress` Table Configuration Verification

## ✅ Verification Complete

Date: Current
Project: Undertone

## Summary

All required configurations for the `reading_progress` table have been verified and confirmed to be properly set up in your Supabase database.

## Configuration Details

### 1. Table Structure ✅
The `reading_progress` table exists with the following columns:
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `user_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to auth.users)
- `book_name` (TEXT)
- `chapter` (INTEGER)
- `read_date` (DATE)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)

### 2. Unique Constraint ✅
A composite unique constraint exists on:
```sql
UNIQUE(user_id, book_name, chapter, read_date)
```
This constraint ensures that:
- Each user can only have one reading progress entry per book, chapter, and date combination
- Supports the `onConflict` upsert operation in your application code

### 3. Row Level Security (RLS) ✅
RLS is **ENABLED** on the table, preventing unauthorized access.

### 4. RLS Policies ✅
The following policies are active:

| Policy | Command | Rule | Description |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|
| `Users can view own reading progress` | SELECT | `auth.uid() = user_id` | Users can only view their own records |
| `Users can insert own reading progress` | INSERT | `auth.uid() = user_id` | Users can only insert records for themselves |
| `Users can update own reading progress` | UPDATE | `auth.uid() = user_id` | Users can only update their own records |
| `Users can delete own reading progress` | DELETE | `auth.uid() = user_id` | Users can only delete their own records |

## Migration Status
- Migration `001_create_reading_progress_tables.sql` has been successfully applied to both local and remote databases
- All table structures, constraints, and policies are active

## Usage in Application

With this configuration, your application can safely use upsert operations like:

```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('reading_progress')
  .upsert({
    user_id: userId,
    book_name: bookName,
    chapter: chapterNumber,
    read_date: readDate
  }, {
    onConflict: 'user_id,book_name,chapter,read_date'
  });
```

The unique constraint ensures that if a record with the same combination already exists, it will be updated rather than creating a duplicate.

## Security Notes
- ✅ RLS ensures users can only access their own data
- ✅ All operations require authentication (`auth.uid()`)
- ✅ Service role key should only be used server-side
- ✅ Client-side operations use the anon key with RLS protection

## Files Created for Verification
1. `verify-table-config.mjs` - Node.js script to verify table configuration
2. `verify-reading-progress-config.sql` - SQL queries for manual verification
3. `SUPABASE_TABLE_VERIFICATION.md` - This documentation file

## Next Steps
Your Supabase table configuration is complete and ready for use. No additional configuration is needed for the `reading_progress` table.
